Draft Pitch:

Hello Mr. Herzong & Wells,

I’d like to pitch a story that looks beyond the betting slips to explore how online sports betting has rapidly overtaken Indiana’s gambling market — and who’s profiting behind the scenes.

Since mobile sports betting launched in Indiana in October 2019, the industry has exploded. While retail sportsbooks exist, they’ve been steadily eclipsed by online platforms, which now account for the vast majority of sports wagers in the state. The public-facing apps like FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, and others are just one layer. What’s less understood is the network of companies, partnerships, and in-state casinos enabling this surge.



```{r}

library(tidyverse)

trends_data <- read_csv(multiTimeline.csv, skip = 1)  # skip the first row (Google adds metadata)

# View column names
colnames(trends_data)

# Plot the trend over time
ggplot(trends_data, aes(x = Week, y = `sports betting: (United States)`)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Google Trends: 'Sports Betting' in Indiana",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Interest Over Time") +
  theme_minimal()


```


Each mobile sportsbook in Indiana must partner with a local brick-and-mortar casino. That’s opened the door for a mix of major national brands and global players to take hold of the market:

FanDuel (owned by Flutter Entertainment, based in Dublin) is partnered with Belterra Casino.

DraftKings (publicly traded in the U.S.) works with Ameristar Casino in East Chicago.

BetMGM is backed by MGM Resorts and UK-based Entain, partnered with Belterra.

Caesars Online operates under the Caesars Entertainment umbrella, tied to its physical casino holdings.

BetRivers is run by Rush Street Interactive, a Chicago-based company, via French Lick Casino.

PointsBet (recently acquired by Fanatics) partnered with Hollywood Casino.

Unibet, from Sweden’s Kindred Group, is paired with Horseshoe Hammond.

BetAmerica (owned by Churchill Downs) has been rebranded or absorbed into TwinSpires.

Betway, owned by Super Group (a global brand based in Malta), is also active in Indiana.
	

This story would explore:
The growth and dominance of online betting over retail locations, using state revenue data


How Google search interest in sports betting has sustained high levels since 2019
The little-known partnerships between global corporations and local Indiana casinos


Whether Indiana is becoming a model — or cautionary tale — for other states following suit


I believe there’s real value in tracing both the cultural shift and the business web that powers Indiana’s mobile betting boom.
